## Mobile App interface for Smart Node

### What is the work being proposed?
 - Context about blox and hardware infrastructure
 - Expand Node Operators to normies
 - Develop a cross-platform mobile app
 - Easy-to-navigate UI with opinionated config
 - Making RocketPool experience Grandmother friendly!

### Is there any related work this builds off of?
 - We should search for it
 - Describe similar UI in Fula

### Will the results of this project be entirely open source? If not, which parts will not be, why, and under what license will they be published?
 - Yes, [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
 - Everything is open-source

## Benefits - enter N/A where appropriate
 - Expand Node Operators to normies

### How does this help people looking to stake ETH for rETH?
 - This is a bridge for mass adoption

### How does this help rETH holders?
 - Make the network more decentralized
 - Help move nodes from the cloud to the edge

### How does this help people looking to run a Rocket Pool node for the first time?
 - We are making this as easy as a pie!

### How does this help people already running a Rocket Pool node?
 - Not in the scope of this grant, but in the future we can add a feature to have this UI for already running nodes.

### How does this help the Rocket Pool community?
 - Can tell their non-geek friends about it

### How does this help RPL holders?
 - Provides the means to massively decentralize the infrastructure and add a huge user base of node operators

### What other non-RPL protocols, DAOs, projects, or individuals, would stand to benefit from this grant?
 - Functionland
 - SSV Network
 
### Will the resulting project be open source?
 - YES
