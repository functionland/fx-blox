### What is the background of the person(s) doing the work? What experience do they have with such projects in the past?

Functionland started as a participant of 2021 Filecoin Hackathon, in which our backend project (named “Box” at the time) [won the first place](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/249k-for-17-projects-from-dorahacks-filecoin-grant-hackathon/), and our mobile photo gallery app (named “Photos” at the time, now renamed to “FxFotos”) won the third place.

[This blog post](https://dev.to/fx/google-photos-open-source-alternative-with-react-native-80c) announcing these projects, we amassed 500+ stars on GiHub on the first week.

We also ran a [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/box-first-free-forever-cloud-storage-alternative#/) for the hardware, where we raised over half a million dollars for the devices (shipping starts April).

Functionland was incorporated in Canada after the Hackathon and [we closed a $1.1M seed](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/functionland-raises-1-1m-in-seed-funding-830473543.html) round in January 2022.

Essentially, we are a team of 20 developers, software architects, UI/UX designers, testers and… with an endless thirst to bring the true essence of blockchain into people’s life.
I’m Keyvan, and I’m representing this great team. If you want to know more about our team, there is more in this link: [Functionland’s Team of Ninjas](https://mehrandvd.com/2022/12/18/building-a-ninja-team-for-fxland/)
